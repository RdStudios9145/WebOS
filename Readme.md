## Running

The easiest way to use is to go to <https://rdstudios9145.github.io/webos>

You can also run it on your own computer by starting a simple web server. The easiest way to do this is with pything, by running `python -m http.server 8000` in the root directory. Make sure to open `localhost:8000` in your browser.
